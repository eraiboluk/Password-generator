# Password generator

Version 1.0

As you know, internet privacy has reached a very important level recently. For this reason, we must be very careful when determining and saving passwords that we use on the Internet.

This program is designed to create very strong passwords and also to store them without saving them anywhere.

This program allows you to create your strong password using a simple algorithm and some parameters (the number of haphazard and the first 2 letters of the site or service we will create the password for) that you will set your password.

As for the storage issue, since the haphazard number you set and the site name you enter will be clear, you can remember your password using the same parameters, and get rid of an easily hackable password manager like google chrome.

In the future, algorithms can be developed and other features can be added.

It performed quite well on sites where you can type your password to measure your password strength on the Internet.
